## Algorithm Details
The Java placement prediction project uses a Linear Regression approach for prediction, specifically:

1. Basic Linear Trend Prediction : The main prediction algorithm is implemented in the PredictionUtil.java file. 
2. The implementation uses Java Streams API to process the data and make predictions based on historical placement data.


1.Data Filtering : The algorithm first filters historical placement data by branch if specified.
2.Trend Analysis : It calculates average package trends by grouping data by year and computing averages.
3.Linear Prediction : The method predictLinearTrend() is used to predict future values based on historical trends.
4.Statistical Analysis : The algorithm also identifies top sectors and job roles by frequency analysis using Java Streams' grouping and counting operations.

## Dataset Used
The algorithm works with the Placement_Data_Full_Class.csv dataset which contains student information including:

- Academic performance (10th, 12th, degree percentages)
- Educational background (board, stream)
- Work experience
- Specialization
- MBA percentage
- Placement status and salary
