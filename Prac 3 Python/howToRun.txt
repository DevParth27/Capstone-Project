## Algorithm Details
The Java phishing detection project uses a rule-based approach for URL analysis, specifically:

1. Feature Extraction : The main detection algorithm is implemented in the PhishingDetector.java file.
2. The implementation uses Java's pattern matching and string processing to extract features from URLs.


1.URL Analysis : The algorithm extracts various features from URLs such as length, special characters, and suspicious keywords.
2.Scoring System : It calculates a phishing score based on weighted features extracted from the URL.
3.Classification : URLs with scores above a threshold (0.6) are classified as phishing websites.
4.Confidence Calculation : The algorithm provides a confidence score for each prediction.

## Features Analyzed
The algorithm analyzes multiple URL characteristics including:

- URL length (longer URLs are more suspicious)
- Special character counts (dots, hyphens, underscores, etc.)
- Presence of suspicious keywords (secure, account, login, etc.)
- IP address detection (URLs with IP addresses instead of domain names)
- HTTPS usage (legitimate sites tend to use HTTPS)
- Domain length and subdomain count

## Implementation Structure
The project is organized into several components:

- PhishingDetector.java: Core detection logic and scoring system
- FeatureExtractor.java: Utility for extracting URL features
- DatasetHandler.java: Sample dataset management
- PhishingDetectorPanel.java: User interface for URL checking
- MainApp.java: Main application entry point
